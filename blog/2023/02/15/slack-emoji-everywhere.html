  <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/01/03/tech/shopify-meetings/index.html">According to CNN</a>, the company I work for recently began ‚Äúsplitting internal communication between Slack and <a href="https://www.workplace.com/">Workplace by Meta</a> to be ‚Äúsuper intentional‚Äù about how employees are receiving and sharing different kinds of information‚Äù. Commenting on the super-intentionality of information reception is above my pay grade, but one thing I can say is that Slack has built-in support for custom emoji (emojis? ü§∑) and Workplace by Meta (for those unfamiliar: Facebook, but with your coworkers) does not.</p>

<p>Custom emoji add a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em> to messages on Slack that can make conversations on other platforms feel shallow in comparison. The Unicode emoji built in to most modern operating systems are great, but sometimes a feeling can only be perfectly expressed with a custom 22√ó22-CSS-pixel image not defined by a committee. Every time I reach for a custom emoji while composing a text message, email, Messenger reply, Workplace post, GitHub issue, etc, only to remember that they‚Äôre not available, their absence makes me sad.</p>

<p>Slack runs in the browser; several of these other platforms run in the browser; I control the browser‚Ä¶ so why not break Slack emoji out of their tab and unleash them on the rest of the Internet? I don‚Äôt do much web development, so this seemed like a fun excuse to play around with the WebExtensions APIs and see what I could build.</p>

<p>Introducing: the creatively named cross-compatible browser extension, <a href="https://github.com/sjahu/slack-emoji-everywhere"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">slack-emoji-everywhere</code></a>.</p>

<p>There‚Äôs more info in the linked GitHub repo‚Äôs readme, but, as a TL;DR, the extension uses a signed-in Slack workspace to automagically download emoji and injects them into non-Slack webpages in place of text <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">:emoji:</code> tokens. It uses the same undocumented (publicly, at least) API endpoints that Slack‚Äôs web client uses for looking up and searching emoji; it automatically authenticates these API requests using the logged-in users‚Äôs credentials; it does some caching to avoid looking up the same emoji every time it sees a token; and it optionally supports communicating with a custom, non-Slack emoji server that implements the same API.</p>

<p>I probably won‚Äôt officially release this extension publicly since I don‚Äôt want the support burden and I‚Äôm sure it violates Slack‚Äôs EULA, but it was a fun experiment.</p>
