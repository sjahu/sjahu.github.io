  <p>Hello, world. Welcome to my website.</p>

<p>I’ve (finally) moved my online presence to GitHub pages because the VPS provider that I’ve been using for the past several years is shutting down my server in a couple days as they roll out a new line of newer, more expensive products.</p>

<p>I haven’t got any specific plans for this site, yet, but we’ll see; maybe I’ll come up with something interesting to say.</p>
