title: TRETAKT Teardown
---

I'd like to use a smart plug to control an ungrounded lamp plugged into an ungrounded extension cord. The problem is that any smart plugs I can find have a ground prong, which will get in the way. I could put a smart plug between the wall outlet and the extension cord, but then the plug would control all of the extension cord's receptacles, and I might want to use something else plugged into it while the lamp is off. I'd prefer to plug the lamp into the smart plug and plug _that_ into the extension cord.

Nobody's gonna bother selling a two-prong smart plug because ungrounded wall outlets are very rare this century and you can always plug an ungrounded two-prong device into a three-prong outlet. My use case is fairly marginal.

The easiest answer here, obviously, is "don't do that". Anyways...

I already use [IKEA TRETAKT](https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/tretakt-plug-smart-40556511/) smart plugs in a couple places and I figured it was pretty likely that their smart circuitry isn't grounded. If I could confirm that, I could safely modify one for ungrounded use. I couldn't find a teardown online for the North American version of the plug, so I picked up a new one and cracked it open.

It was immediately apparent that the ground prong is completely isolated from the the smart plug circuitry. What's more, it can be easily -- and non-destructively -- removed, to make a two-prong smart plug.

Here are a few photos of the disassembled TRETAKT, in case they're useful to anyone else.
