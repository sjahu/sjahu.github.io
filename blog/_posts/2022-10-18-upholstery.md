title: Vastly underestimating the work involved in furniture re-upholstery
---

This is basically a photo-dump of a project I've been meaning to post about for a while. In October 2020, I bought a used La-Z-Boy reclining loveseat for $75 off Kijiji. The couch was astonishingly ugly (what even were the '90s??<sup>â€ </sup>), but it was a good deal and pretty comfortable. I covered it with a blanket and, later, with an approximately-fitting tie-on cover, but always had the idea of re-upholstering it properly in the back of my mind, since both covers looked pretty bad.

In July 2021 I had some time off work, so I eyeballed the surface area of the couch and bought 10 yards of heavy fabric (at $20/yd!) and a staple gun. I had intended to remove the existing covering and just kind of drape and staple the new fabric to the frame, but I quickly realized that that lazy approach would not produce a quality result. I borrowed a sewing machine from a neighbour and began what would become a 14-day effort to restore the loveseat (nearly full-time the first week and in the evenings after work the second).

*<sup>â€ </sup>Interestingly, according to the tag, the couch was manufactured in October 1999 in Waterloo, ON, about a kilometre from where I was living at the time I bought it. La-Z-Boy shut down its Canadian manufaturing operations [in 2005](https://investors.la-z-boy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/la-z-boy-close-canadian-upholstery-facility).*

  1) The original couch. What were they thinking? What was <i>I</i> thinking?

  2) Much improved.

  3) More convenient, but a step back aesthetically.
