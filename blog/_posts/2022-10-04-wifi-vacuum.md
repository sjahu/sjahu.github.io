title: Smartening up my dumb vacuum

For the last couple years, I've had a habit of vacuuming my apartment Thursday afternoons while listening to a weekly live-streamed all-hands meeting for work. Mid summer, this meeting was rescheduled to a monthly cadence, so, with my dedicated vacuuming time gone and my floor getting dusty, I bought a robot vacuum.

The same week, iRobot, maker of the Roomba line of robotic vacuums, was [in the news](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/05/tech/amazon-irobot-roomba/index.html) after announcing a deal to sell out to Amazon. I'm not interested in handing Amazon a map of my apartment, so that took any of iRobot's Wi-Fi-enabled vacuums (which is all of them) off the table. Amazon acquisition aside, I'm not a fan of Wi-Fi-enabled appliances anyway because I don't trust them to a) be secure, b) respect my privacy, c) work well, or d) function at all after the manufacturer inevitably drops support for them a few years down the line. All of these "features" usually come at a premium, too!

So, I bought an [Anker Eufy RoboVac 11S](https://www.amazon.ca/Eufy-BoostIQ-Super-Thin-Self-Charging-Medium-Pile/dp/B079QYYGF1) (from Amazon ðŸ™ˆ) for a cool $169.99. The 11S is basically a sleeker-looking clone of the [original Roomba from 2002](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Roomba_original.jpg); it has almost the exact same feature set, minus support for "virtual walls", which are infrared beacons that let you restrict the Roomba from passing through certain doorways. Critically, like the 2002 Roomba, the 11S has no Wi-Fi-- it's controlled using an infrared remote to select between cleaning modes and schedule cleaning sessions in advance. I figured this would meet my needs perfectly: random-pattern Wi-Fi-less cleaning on a schedule; all I'd have to do was empty the dustbin.

{% image /assets/images/blog/2022-10-04/phoebe_meets_robovac.jpg small %}

As it turned out, the remote's scheduling feature could only schedule cleanings up to 24 hours in advance; not "every afternoon at hh:mm" or "every second day at hh:mm", just "the next time it's hh:mm", which, in my opinion, is little better than just manually starting the vacuum. I quickly got tired of doing either and set out to automate the automatic vacuum.

## Plan of Attack

1. Record the remote's infrared signals.
2. Program an [ESP32 Wi-Fi microcontroller](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?SearchText=esp32) to transmit appropriate remote signals when triggered by HomeKit (Apple's iOS-integrated smart home system).
3. Implant the chip into the vacuum.
4. Control the vacuum from my phone and use HomeKit automations to schedule vacuuming.

Let's get to it.

## Recording Infrared Signals

Like the infrared remote controls for most consumer electronics, the Eufy remote emits signals consisting of sequences of bits encoded as timed pulses of 940 nm light modulated at 38 kHZ, to distinguish the signal from environmental interference, e.g. from sunlight. Recording the signals was straightforward: I plugged a 38 kHz IR demodulator into an ESP32 development board, uploaded an IR receiving [demo sketch](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote/blob/master/examples/SimpleReceiver/SimpleReceiver.ino) from the [`Arduino-IRremote`](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote) Arduino library (the ESP32 is Arduino-compatible), and blasted away, logging the codes output in the Arduino IDE's serial monitor for each signal received from the remote.

{% image /assets/images/blog/2022-10-04/ir_demodulator_esp32.jpg medium %}

The output from `Arduino-IRremote`'s receiver demo looks like this:

{% highlight c++ linenos %}
uint32_t tRawData[]={0x7D16, 0xA4FF};
IrSender.sendPulseDistanceWidthFromArray(38, 3050, 2950, 550, 1500, 550, 500, &tRawData[0], 48, PROTOCOL_IS_LSB_FIRST, <millisofRepeatPeriod>, <numberOfRepeats>);
{% endhighlight %}

Each received transmission is encoded as an array of 32-bit segments, where, if the signal were to be replayed, the segments would be transmitted in order, each one sent bit-by-bit with the least significant bit first. The second line of output demonstrates how to play back a signal, it includes all the parameters that characterize the transmission:

### Signal parameters

```text
Frequency:    38 kHz
Header mark:  3050 Î¼s
Header space: 2950 Î¼s
One mark:     550 Î¼s
One space:    1500 Î¼s
Zero mark:    550 Î¼s
Zero space:   500 Î¼s
Length:       48 bits
LSB/MSB:      LSB first
```

I converted the 32-bit segmented output for all the commands I recorded to a bitwise representation for easier analysis:

{% highlight python linenos %}
def ir_data_to_bit_string(data_array, n_bits, lsb_first = True):
  str = ""
  for segment in data_array:
    segment_bits = "{:0{width}b}".format(segment, width=(32 if n_bits > 32 else n_bits))
    if lsb_first:
      segment_bits = segment_bits[::-1]
    str = str + segment_bits
    n_bits = n_bits - 32
  return str
{% endhighlight %}

After some staring and squinting, I derived the following specification for the signals generated by the remote:

#### Checksum

The final byte of the message is a checksum. By inspection, I determined that it's equal to the first 5 bytes added together, with the most significant bit of the result dropped.

#### Other notes

- Obviously, not all possible combinations are represented above.
- The current time and scheduled cleaning time can be included with any other command.
- The current time has minute precision, while a future cleaning can only be scheduled in 15 minute increments. That's because there are 2 bytes for setting the time and only 1 for setting a schedule.
- Up, Down, Left, and Right commands can be sent in any fan mode.
- Spiral and Edge cleaning commands are always sent with the fan mode set to Max.
- I didn't really need to figure out any of this-- I could have just naively recorded the relevant commands from the remote, but I wanted to understand what they meant. My curiouity was piqued when I noticed that same button triggered a different signal depending what time it was, hinting at the fact made clear above that the current time is encoded in every transmission. 

## HomeKit

With the remote signals decoded, the next step was to figure out how to get the ESP32 and HomeKit to play together.

[HomeKit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HomeKit) is Apple's framework for controlling smart devices. Devices can be controlled by Siri or using Apple's [Home App](https://www.apple.com/home-app/). The UI/UX of the app is entirely dictated by Apple, with manufacturers getting no say in how the user interacts with a device. Under the hood, communication between HomeKit and smart devices is based on the [HomeKit Accessory Protocol](https://developer.apple.com/homekit/specification/). HAP's model consists of _accessories_ (devices), which implement _services_ ("Light Bulb", "Fan", "Temperature Sensor", etc.), which possess _characteristics_ (e.g. "Brightness", "On", and "CurrentTemperature"), which have a _state_ (a boolean or an integer, mainly). An accessory may implement multiple services; services, depending on the type, must possess certain characteristics and may possess others. A "Light Bulb", for example, must possess an "On" characteristic (_true_ or _false_) but may also include "Brightness", or "Hue", or a couple other optional characteristics; how these characteristics are displayed to the user is up to the Home app.

There's an extremely polished HomeKit library for the ESP32 called [HomeSpan](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/), which abstracts away all of the networking details and HAP-related communication,  basically trivializing writing the software for a HomeKit device to 1) describing the accessory/service/characteristic relationships and 2) writing the logic for controlling the physical device. HomeSpan includes an excellent tutorial in the form of 20 progressively more complicated [examples](https://github.com/HomeSpan/HomeSpan/tree/master/examples) which walk you through the features of HAP and HomeSpan.

There's not much more to say about HomeKit, except that it's conspicuously missing a "Robot Vacuum" service (this is probably a pain in the ass for iRobot-- the company _just this year_ [announced support for Siri shortcuts](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/irobot-releases-genius-4-0-home-intelligence-doubles-the-intelligence-for-roomba-i3-and-i3-robot-vacuums-and-more-301504474.html), which are basically a hackier DIY version of HomeKit). I decided that for the convenience of HomeKit integration, my vacuum could just as well pretend to be a fan, which is technically correct, anyway.

Here's the code. Points of interest:

- `DEV_Vacuum` extends the built-in `Service::Fan` class and overrides its `update` and `loop` methods. `update` is called when HomeKit sends a request to update the device state; `loop` is called repeatedly and allows the device to do things and communicate state changes back to HomeKit as necessary.
- A reset button clears the ESP32's non-volatile storage. This puts the device back into a Wi-Fi access point setup mode in which you can configure Wi-Fi credentials and HomeKit pairing information.
- The "Fan" service has an "Active" characteristic (on/off) and a "RotationSpeed" characteristic, for which I'm mapping 1 to Standard, 2 to BoostIQ, and 3 to Max (BoostIQ is a "smart" combination of Standard and Max).
- In "auto" mode, the stock vacuum cleans for 100 minutes or until the battery is low, then returns home. I've programmed the HomeKit controller to send the vacuum home after 90 minutes, since it doesn't have any way to recognize when the vacuum has independently decided it's done.
- Each remote signal is sent four times to reduce the chance of any commands being missed (I didn't do this originally and had to take the vacuum apart again to upload a fix ðŸ¤¦).
  - Incidentally, I [helped fix a bug](https://github.com/Arduino-IRremote/Arduino-IRremote/pull/1028) in the IR library related to repeating signals.

## Vacuum Surgery

The final step was implanting the new Wi-Fi brain into the 11S. Disassembling the vacuum was extremely straightforward-- it was obviously designed with repairability in mind. Luckily for me, despite the 'S' in 11S standing for "slim", they didn't squeeze out all the empty space, either. One corner of the shell, near the power switch, has a big empty space perfectly sized to accomodate my ESP32 board and a voltage regulator.

{% image /assets/images/blog/2022-10-04/empty_space.jpg medium %}

I went back and forth a bit on how to power the ESP32. The ESP32 runs on 3.3 V; the dev board includes a linear regulator to accomodate 4.75 V - 12 V input (so it can be powered by USB). The vacuum's battery, consisting of four 18650 cells<sup>â€ </sup>, has a nominal voltage of 14.4 V (real voltage: 16.4 V). The vacuum's logic board seems to run mostly on 3.3 V, but I measured 5 V across some sensors, and, although I didn't test them, I assume the motors run on the full battery voltage. I considered powering the ESP32 straight from the logic board's 3.3 V circuitry, but since the ESP can draw > 150 mA when using Wi-Fi and I had no idea what tolerences were built in to the 11S main board, rather than risk melting/enflaming anything, I opted to wire in a [buck converter](https://www.amazon.ca/Zixtec-Converter-Voltage-Regulator-3-0-40V/dp/B07VVXF7YX) directly to the battery and power switch to drop the 16.4 V battery voltage down to 3.3 V (buck converters are semiconductor based and vastly more efficient than linear regulators, which downshift voltage by dissipating extra power as heat).

<sup>â€ </sup>*18650s are truly the modern AA. They power Teslas, e-cigarettes, flashlights, laptops, portable power banks, e-bikes, Bluetooth speakers, robo vacuums...*

I mentioned a reset button earlier-- if I have to change my Wi-Fi SSID or password, I don't want to have to disassemble the vacuum to access the ESP32's USB serial interface. I left a long wire connected to the button input and drew it out into the battery compartment, which is easily accessible from the outside. Touching the wire to the negative contact on the battery completes the button circuit and tells the ESP32 to clear its non-volatile storage (I left a note to remind my future self how this works).

{% image /assets/images/blog/2022-10-04/note_to_self.jpg small %}

Putting it all together, we get this:

- Buck converter wired in to the battery's negative lead and the hard power switch.
- ESP32 powered from the buck converter.
- Infrared LED connected to the ESP32 and pointed directly at one of the vacuum's several IR receivers.
- Reset wire tucked into the battery compartment.

Ta-da! I can now control the vacuum with Siri ("Hey Siri, turn on/off the vacuum"), manually in the Home app, or with HomeKit automations (e.g. "whenever everybody is out of the the house while the sun is up, turn on the vacuum for 30 minutes"). ðŸŽ‰
