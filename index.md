Hello, world. Welcome to my website.

I've (finally) moved my online presence to GitHub pages because the VPS provider that I've been using for the past several years is shutting down my server in a couple days as they roll out a new line of newer, more expensive products.

I haven't got any specific plans for this site, yet, but we'll see; maybe I'll come up with something interesting to say.
